## Conclusion
Through the above analysis, we can get the following conclusions.
- July to September is the busiest period for Airbnb in Seattle, and prices are about $30 higher than in January and February, which is probably related to summer holidays. And no matter what the period is, weekend rates are $5–10 higher than weekday rates.
  City centers and popular tourist spots are generally more expensive, averaging $70–100 more than the lower priced places.
- Improving the value and sanitary conditions of the accommodation may be effective in earning a high review scores rating and even gaining more repeat customers.
- The host performance has a higher correlation to the price than that of the convenient factors.
